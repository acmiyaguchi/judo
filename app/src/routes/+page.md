## content

- [waza (techniques)](./waza) - Browse animations of techniques by category.

## references and resources

The video animations have been derived from the [_KODOKAN JUDO: 100 Techniques_][100-techniques] series by [Kodokan Judo Institute] and the [IJF Academy].
I encourage watching the videos to better understand mechanics of each technique with different angles.
The animations here are useful for quick reference and review.

The Kodokan has [definitions and descriptions of official techniques][kodokan techniques] on their website.
