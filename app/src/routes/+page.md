## content

- [waza](./waza) - Browse animations of techniques (waza) by category.

## references and resources

The video animations have been derived from the [_KODOKAN JUDO: 100 Techniques_][100-techniques] series by [Kodokan Judo Institute] and the [IJF Academy].
I highly encourage viewing the original videos for a better understanding of the mechanics of each technique.
The animations are intended to be for quick reference and review.
