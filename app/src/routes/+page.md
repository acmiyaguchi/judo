## references and resources

The video animations have been derived from the [_KODOKAN JUDO: 100 Techniques_][100-techniques] series by [Kodokan Judo Institute] and the [IJF Academy].
I encourage watching the videos to better understand mechanics of each technique.
The animations here are useful for quick reference and review.
The Kodokan also has [definitions and descriptions of official techniques][kodokan techniques] on their website.
If you want alternative video sources, the _The Judo Way of Life_ channel has left and right-handed [demonstrations of gokyo-no-waza][judo-way gokyo].
_Efficient Judo_ has demonstrations of [all 67 throwing techniques][efficient judo], among other useful material on their channel.

If you search judo instructionals on YouTube, you'll likely find [Shintaro Higashi's channel][shintaro higashi].
He's clear and concise, and explains lots of useful details.
For a broad range of judo/martial arts topics, I recommend the [Tatami Talk][tatami talk] podcast.
It gives good insight into judo culture on the west coast, and is generally entertaining and insightful.
[Hal Sharp's channel][hal sharp] has a variety of clinics and older, full-featured films.
If you're into competition footage, [Judo Highlights][judo highlights] has quite a bit of it.
He has a great eye with commentary that adds to the experience.
